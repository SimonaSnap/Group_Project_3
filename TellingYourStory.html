<div id="resumeText">1. Telling Your Story</div></div>

<div id="TipsContainer">
    <div id="TipsTitle">A. Don’t Put Everything on There </div>
<div id="TipsContent">
    <ul>
    <li>Your resume should not have every work experience you’ve ever had listed on it. </li><br>
    <li>Think of your resume not as a comprehensive list of your career history, but as a marketing document selling you as the perfect person for the job.</li><br>
    <li>For each resume you send out, you’ll want to highlight only the accomplishments and skills that are most relevant to the job at hand.</li><br></div></div></ul>
<br>
<div id="TipsContainer">
    <div id="TipsTitle">B. But Keep a Master List of All Jobs </div>
 <div id="TipsContent">
    <ul>
    <li>
        Since you’ll want to be swapping different information in and out depending on the job you’re applying to, keep a resume outline or master resume on your computer 
        where you keep any information you’ve ever included on a resume: old positions, bullet points tailored for different applications, special projects that only sometimes make sense to include.  </li><br>
    <li>Then, when you’re crafting each resume, it’s just a matter of cutting and pasting relevant information together.</li><br>
    <li>Think of this as your brag file.</li><br></div></div></ul>
<br>
 <div id="TipsContainer">
    <div id="TipsTitle">C. Put the Best Stuff “Above the Fold” </div>
    <div id="TipsContent">
    <ul>
    <li>In marketing speak, “above the fold” refers to what you see on the front half of a folded newspaper (or, in the digital age, before you scroll down on a website), but basically it’s your first impression of a document.  </li><br>
    <li>In resume speak, it means you should make sure your best experiences and accomplishments are visible on the top third of your resume. </li><br>
    <li>This top section is what the hiring manager is going to see first—and what will serve as a hook for someone to keep on reading. </li><br>
    <li>Therefore, Focus on putting your best, most relevant experiences first!</li></div></div></ul>
<br>
<div id="TipsContainer">
    <div id="TipsTitle">D. Ditch the Objective Statement </div>
    <div id="TipsContent">
    <ul>
    <li>The only occasion when an objective section makes sense is when you’re making a huge career change and need to explain from the get-go why your experience doesn’t match up with the position you’re applying to.  </li><br>
    <li>In every other case? Consider whether a summary statement would be right for you—or just nix it altogether to save space and focus on making the rest of your resume stellar.</li></div></div></ul>

<br>
<div id="TipsContainer">
<div id="TipsTitle">E. Keep it (Reverse) Chronological</div>
<div id="TipsContent">
<ul>
<li>There are lots of different ways to organize the information on your resume—like the functional resume or combination resume—but the good old reverse chronological (where your most recent experience is listed first) is still your best bet. </li><br>
<li>Unless it’s absolutely necessary in your situation, skip the skills-based resume—hiring managers might wonder what you’re hiding.</li></div></div></ul>

<br>
<div id="TipsContainer">
    <div id="TipsTitle">F. Keep it to a Page</div>
 <div id="TipsContent">
    <ul>
    <li>
        The two- (or more!) page resume is a hotly debated topic, but the bottom line is this—you want the information here to be concise, and making yourself keep it to one page is a good way to force yourself to do this. </li><br>
    <li>If you truly have enough relevant and important experience, training, and credentials to showcase on more than one page of your resume, then go for it. </li><br>
    <li>But if you can tell the same story in less space? Do. </li><br></div></div></ul>

<br>
<div id="TipsContainer">
    <div id="TipsTitle">G. Consider an Online Supplement</div>
    <div id="TipsContent">
    <ul>
    <li>Instead of trying to have your resume cover everything, cover the most important details on that document, and then include a link to your personal website, where you can dive more into what makes you the ideal candidate. </li><br></div></div></ul>
